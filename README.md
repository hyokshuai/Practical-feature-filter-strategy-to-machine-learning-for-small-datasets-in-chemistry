This file is for the paper: Practical feature filter strategy to machine learning for small datasets in chemistry

The code contains two parts:

**Part 1: prediction of adsorption energies (automl+ml)**\\
The training set for the adsorption energies is available at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b12670


**Part 2: prediction of sublimation enthalpies (automl+ml)**\\
This part is lacking of the training set. The data that support the findings of sublimation enthalpies in this study are available from FactSage but restrictions apply to the availability of these data,
which were used under license for the current study, and so are not publicly available. Data are however available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request and with permission of FactSage.
